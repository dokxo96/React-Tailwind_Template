# React 😎 + Tailwind 💨 Project Starter Template 
Use until create-react-app doesn't support PostCSS 8.

## How to use?
1. Do 
 ` git clone https://github.com/dokxo96/React-Tailwind_Template.git` 
2. In the command line, do to install all the dependencies.
 `npm install` 
3. To run.
 `npm start` ⚙️

## Why did I make this?
I was using Tailwind with react a lot and felt the whole process of setting up tailwind every time quite the fuss.  

#### Why the fuss?
Create React App doesn't support PostCSS 8 yet so you need to install the Tailwind CSS v2.0 PostCSS 7. Also since Create React App doesn't let you override the PostCSS configuration natively, CRACO is used.
